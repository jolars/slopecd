\subsection{Details of \textsf{glmnet} versus \textsf{SLOPE} Comparison}
\label{sec:slope-vs-glmnet}

In this experiment, we ran the \pkg{glmnet}~\parencite{friedman2022} and \pkg{SLOPE}~\parencite{larsson2022d} packages on the \dataset{bcTCGA} dataset, selecting the regularization sequence \(\lambda\) such that there were 100 nonzero coefficients at the optimum.
We used a duality gap of \(10^{-6}\) as stopping criteria.
The data was standardized.
The code is available as a supplement.
