\section{IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF SOLVERS}
\label{sec:solver-details}

\subsection{ADMM}

Our implementation of the solver is based on \textcite{boyd2011}.
For high-dimensional sparse \(X\), we use the numerical LSQR algorithm~\parencite{paige1982} instead of the typical direct linear system solver.
We originally implemented the solver using the adaptive step size (\(\rho\)) scheme from \textcite{boyd2010} but discovered that it performed poorly.
Instead, we used \(\rho = 100\) and have provided benchmarks of the alternative configurations in \Cref{sec:admm-benchmarks}.

\subsection{Newt-ALM}

The implementation of the solver is based on the pseudo-code provided in \textcite{Ziyan2019}.
According to the authors' suggestions, we use the Matrix inversion lemma for high-dimensional and sparse \(X\) and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method if, in addition, \(n\) is large.
Please see the source code for further details regarding hyper-parameter choices for the algorithm.

After having completed our own implementation of the algorithm, we received an implementation directly from the authors.
Since our own implementation performed better, however, we opted to use it instead.
