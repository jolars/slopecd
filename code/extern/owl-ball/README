This README file is based on the one here:

1. Introduction
---------------

This directory contains a Matlab implementation for the
OWL formulation

  Minimize   1/2*||Ax-b||_2^2  subject to:  sum_i (w_i * |x|_[i]) <= epsilon  
       x

where |x|_[i] denotes the i-th largest entry in |x|. The entries
in w must be nonnegative and in non-increasing order. When
w is a constant vector, the above formulation reduces to:

   Minimize 1/2*||Ax-b||_2^2  subject to: w_1 * ||x||_1 <= epsilon
       b


2. Compiling
------------

In order to use the Matlab version of the solver OWL_constrained_regression, it
is necessary to compile the Mex interface. The easiest way to
do this is to run the provided make_mex script from Matlab (but make sure you modify it first). Make sure that Matlab has access to a compiler. To setup a compiler
type 'mex -setup' from the Matlab command line.

If the above is not working, try starting matlab from the terminal with a command like

LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 matlab

and then running make_mex. Note that you will need to find the directory containing libstdc++.so.6.   

3. Example script
-----------------

The file synthetic_regression_test.m contains a medium scale regression test.
