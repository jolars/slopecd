\section{FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS}

To prepare a supplementary pdf file, we ask the authors to use \texttt{aistats2022.sty} as a style file and to follow the same formatting instructions as in the main paper.
The only difference is that the supplementary material must be in a \emph{single-column} format.
You can use \texttt{supplement.tex} in our starter pack as a starting point, or append the supplementary content to the main paper and split the final PDF into two separate files.

Note that reviewers are under no obligation to examine your supplementary material.

\section{MISSING PROOFS}

The supplementary materials may contain detailed proofs of the results that are missing in the main paper.

\subsection{Proof of Lemma 3}

\textit{In this section, we present the detailed proof of Lemma 3 and then [ ... ]}

\section{ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS}

If you have additional experimental results, you may include them in the supplementary materials.

\subsection{The Effect of Regularization Parameter}

\textit{Our algorithm depends on the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Figure 1 below illustrates the effect of this parameter on the performance of our algorithm. As we can see, [ ... ]}
