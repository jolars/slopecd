For a fixed non-increasing and non-negative sequence \(\lambda\), the
Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) problem~\cite{bogdan2013,bogdan2015}
is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:slope-problem}
  \operatorname{minimize}_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^p}
  P(\beta) = L(\beta) + J(\beta)
\end{equation}
where we take \(L\) to be smooth and twice differentiable and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sortedl-l1-norm}
  J(\beta) = \sum_{j=1}^p \lambda_j|\beta_{(j)}|
\end{equation}
is the \emph{sorted \(\ell_1\) norm}, defined such that
\[
  |\beta_{(1)}| \geq |\beta_{(2)}| \geq \cdots \geq |\beta_{(p)}|.
\]
